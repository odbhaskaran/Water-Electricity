# Water-Electricity
Rain-Water harvesting and solar energy drawings. 
This project is to describe a method how to harness Rain-Water and how to harness Solar-Energy.  
For this we will need a locality.  Let us put this to work on a street.  Lets name the street as 18th Main Road which has a dead end Road. 
We will concentrate on this block of a Road where some 300 people live.
We will make this people live self sufficient with Rain Water and Solar Energy.
